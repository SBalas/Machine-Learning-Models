# Review of various Machine Learning Models
Knn, Regression (LASSO, Ridge), Logistic, PCA, LDA, QDA, Trees, RF, Boosting
- M2 - knn and imputing missing values - k-nearest neighbors methods is used to predict heart disease in a data set. Various methods are used to impute missing values.
- M3 - Logistic Regression - Logistic Regression used to predict heart disease. ROC curves and related parameters are evaluated.
- M4 - Disciminant Analysis (Linear and Quadratic) - A supervised learning method used to determine the separability of classes. Data set is the temporal distribution of      
       households of different income levels. This method is compared with knn and logistic regression.
              - M5 - Decision Trees - Predict voting outcome based on various demographics characteristics. Trees are generated and various parameters are studied. 
- M5 - Bagging - Bootstrap aggregation is demonstrated and the process is visualized with a simple data set.
- M5 - Random Forest - Multiple trees fit on bootstrapped samples on another data set to predict heart disease. Feature importance gives list of important predictors.
- M5 - Boosting - Regression and classification on residuals. First principles method is used to demonstrate how the algorithm works and then skit-learn is used on another   
       dataset.
